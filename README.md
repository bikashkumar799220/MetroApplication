# MetroApplication
ðŸš† Smart Delhi Metro Route Planner | Built with Graph Algorithms

We developed a Delhi Metro application that efficiently finds the shortest path and optimal routes between stations using Graph Algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, BFS, and DFS. This system helps users navigate the metro network seamlessly by providing the quickest and most efficient travel routes.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Shortest Path Calculation using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
âœ… Connectivity & Route Exploration using BFS & DFS
âœ… Optimized for Speed & Accuracy

This project showcases the power of algorithmic problem-solving in real-world applications, making metro travel smarter and hassle-free! ðŸš€
